# instaclone-mobile
This is from a React Native tutorial from Rocketseat OmniStack course
It depends on a Backend (here [NodeJs Backend](https://github.com/mathvp/instaclone-backend)) to receive data via API (with Axios) and show it to the user.
Socket.io was used to simulate a real time experience, so, when the Like button is pressed, the counter is incremented at the same time 'live'.
